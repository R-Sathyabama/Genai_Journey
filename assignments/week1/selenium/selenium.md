# AI Using Selenium

## Objective
To explore Selenium-based web automation by interacting with multiple
web components on a test website.

## What We Tried
- Handle page redirection
- Upload files programmatically
- Trigger geolocation requests
- Handle modal popups
- Interact with dropdown menus

## How It Works
Selenium WebDriver controls the Chrome browser using explicit waits
and element locators. WebDriver Manager automatically handles driver setup.

## How to Run

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- Google Chrome installed

### Steps
```bash
pip install selenium webdriver-manager
python selenium_bot.py
```

### Output
